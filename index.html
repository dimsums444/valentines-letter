                            I know its been a tough few months, but I'm glad we are where we are now.
                            We still have a long way to go, and I'm hoping that we'll make it.
                            For now, lets just enjoy today. Thank you for making me happy, despite of everything.
                            Thank you for everything.
                            I love you always and forever!
